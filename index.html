           <h2>Portrait of William I</h2>
           <h3 class="animate" data-animate="animateTitle 2s">by : Adriaen Thomasz. Key, c. 1579</h3>
           <p class="animate" data-animate="animateContent 2s">Of the noblemen who rebelled against Phillip II’s Spanish rule of the Netherlands, William of Orange rose to become the great leader of the Dutch Revolt. He defended his own interests, strove for greater independence and advocated freedom of religion. In 1580 Phillip II put a price on his head, and he was assassinated four years later.</p>

           <h2>Protrait of a Gril Dressed in Blue</h2>
           <h3 class="animate" data-animate="animateTitle 2s">by : Johannes Cornelisz. Verspronck, 1641</h3>
           <p class="animate" data-animate="animateContent 2s">Why is this portrait so popular? Because it depicts an adorable child dressed in her Sunday best? As was the custom of the day, the young girl is portrayed as a small adult lady. That she is playing a role is betrayed only by her facial expression. Unfortunately, we know nothing about her identity or her family. Perhaps she resided in Haarlem, like the portraitist Verspronck.</p>

           <h2>Self-Portrait as the Apostle Paul</h2>
           <h3 class="animate" data-animate="animateTitle 2s">by : Rembrandt van Rijn, 1661</h3>
           <p class="animate" data-animate="animateContent 2s">Rembrandt is 55 years old in this self-portrait, and he still looks at himself candidly. Here he assumes the guise of a personage from the Bible, the Apostle Paul. The sword protruding from his cloak and the manuscript in his hands are the apostle’s customary attributes. By using his own face, Rembrandt encouraged the viewer to engage personally with the saint.</p>

           <h2>Merry Drinker</h2>
           <h3 class="animate" data-animate="animateTitle 2s">by : Frans Hals, c. 1628 - c. 1630</h3>
           <p class="animate" data-animate="animateContent 2s">This militiaman merrily raises his glass to toast us – who would not wish to join him? The execution is just as free and easy as the sitter himself: the swift, spontaneously applied brushstrokes enhance the portrait’s sense of liveliness and animation. The man actually seems to be moving. This bravura painting style ensured the continued success of Frans Hals.</p>        </p>
